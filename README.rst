pfbuild
=======

This is a portable builder script for the `fbuild <https://github.com/felix-lang/fbuild>`_. It's automatically generated by `gen.py` and contains the entire fbuild library.

Usage
*****

Grab the `pfbuild` script::

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirbyfan64/pfbuild/master/pfbuild > pfbuild

Now, you can simply run it with any arguments you'd pass to `fbuild`::
    
    $ ./pfbuild -v --configure

Fbuild will automatically be extracted into the `_fbuild` directory and run.

Building it yourself
********************

Run `gen.py`::
    
    $ ./gen.py <path_to_fbuild_root_directory>

Example::
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/felix-lang/fbuild.git
    $ ./gen.py ./fbuild

You can also include pfbuild in your project.
